- Add social media sources (Delphi as embedded twitter agent WIP, just ran out of calls again for the X api again for the month)
- Integrate MA MinferenceLite stack
    - this involves thinking about how to use the `orchestrator` to call for each ticker etc
- Add concurrent/async analysis of multiple stocks and currencies rather than just the current focused one
- Test on Linux and Mac to ensure the input method is compatible (as it was developed on Windows)* pretty sure 'msvcrt' dependancy will break other platforms
