field_descriptions:
  summary: "Provide a comprehensive market analysis (100-150 words) including: 
    - Current price levels and key support/resistance zones
    - Volume analysis vs historical averages with dark pool correlation
    - Relative sector performance and social sentiment alignment
    - Critical price action patterns and narrative momentum
    - Major market-moving events and their social amplification
    - Social media engagement metrics vs price action
    - Retail vs institutional positioning dynamics"

  thinking: "Explore the market's meta-patterns and regime dynamics. Consider how information flows crystallize into price action, where feedback loops are forming, and how different timescales of behavior interact. Identify phase transitions, map current system state against historical regimes, and evaluate where consensus reality may diverge from underlying dynamics. Focus on emergence, entropy in price discovery, and the evolution of narrative structures. Question base assumptions and examine blind spots in conventional analysis frameworks."

  sentiment: "Classify market sentiment using multi-factor analysis:
    - Technical factors: Price momentum (1D, 5D, 1M trends), Volume profile
    - Social signals: Retail sentiment intensity, Social media momentum
    - Institutional metrics: Options flow, Dark pool activity, Block trades
    - Narrative analysis: Story strength, Viral coefficient, Echo chamber effects
    - Cross-platform correlation: Sentiment alignment across channels
    Must return one of: [BULLISH, BEARISH, HAWKISH, CAUTIOUS, NEUTRAL] with confidence score"

  key_factors: "Identify 3-5 market drivers integrating traditional and social metrics:
    - Quantifiable impact metrics (price effect + social amplification)
    - Timeframe relevance and narrative lifecycle stage
    - Correlation strength across technical and social dimensions
    - Source attribution with influence weighting
    - Viral potential assessment
    Format as detailed bullet points with supporting data"

  technical_indicators: "List 3-5 active signals combining technical and social metrics:
    - Traditional indicators: MA convergence (20/50/200), RSI/MACD readings
    - Volume analysis: Standard + dark pool + social engagement correlation
    - Pattern formations with sentiment overlay
    - Support/resistance levels with social consensus strength
    - Narrative-technical alignment scores
    Each with specific values, interpretations, and sentiment correlation"

  risk_factors: "Enumerate 3-5 key risks with comprehensive assessment:
    - Traditional risks: Market dynamics, Technical levels, Fundamentals
    - Social risks: Narrative shifts, Sentiment reversals, Viral decay
    - Probability assessment (High/Medium/Low) across both dimensions
    - Impact magnitude on price and sentiment
    - Time sensitivity including narrative lifecycle
    - Mitigation strategies for both technical and social risks
    Format as structured points with quantitative backing"

  recommendation: "Provide actionable strategy integrating all signals:
    - Entry/exit levels with sentiment confirmation
    - Position sizing based on technical and social conviction
    - Stop loss parameters including sentiment circuit breakers
    - Target objectives with narrative milestones
    - Execution timing considering social momentum
    - Narrative alignment requirements
    Maximum 50 words"

  confidence_level: "Rate analysis confidence (1-5) based on comprehensive metrics:
    1: Limited data, high uncertainty in both technical and social signals
    2: Partial data, significant gaps in either technical or social analysis
    3: Adequate data, some uncertainty in correlation of signals
    4: Strong data, minor gaps in signal integration
    5: Comprehensive data, high certainty in technical-social alignment"

  time_horizon: "Specify exact trading timeframe with narrative considerations:
    - Intraday: Hours to 1 day (viral event driven)
    - Swing: 2-5 days (narrative momentum phase)
    - Position: 1-4 weeks (sentiment trend alignment)
    - Intermediate: 1-6 months (narrative cycle completion)
    - Long-term: 6+ months (fundamental-narrative convergence)
    Include both technical and social cycle alignment requirements"

  timeline_detection: "Detect the polarity of the timeline, dark or ok
    - Dark: 0-49
    - Ok: 50-99
    This is contingent on the current political discourse, market sentiment and the general vibe from the news cycle"
